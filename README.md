# 2023-NEON-Data-Project-
Welcome to the 2023-NEON-Data-Project- wiki! This semester will be the first year Ecosystems Ecology will be having a lab portion added to the course and for the final project you and your group will be looking at National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and work on data wrangling, standardizing and visualizing carbon pools in trees, soils, roots, and herbaceous biomass. We will be using the utilitiesNEON package to access data through an API for the sites your group selects and each choose one of the above carbon pools.

After completing the NEON data project you will:

- Understand how to access and use NEON data and what types of questions we can ask with these data.
- Be able to conduct data carpentry, run statistical analyses (t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression), and make visualizations (bar plots, box plots, and line plots) using RStudio.
- Gain experience collaborating on scientific projects by working with your peers on data synthesis and presentation.
